        //    If you’re responding to an ASP.NET request, then it’s an ASP.NET request context.
        //    Otherwise, it’s usually a thread pool context.

        //processing is asynchronous (which it is not). Instead, use Task.Run at the point of the call:

        //can just use throw, try, and catch exactly like normal and it will all work.
